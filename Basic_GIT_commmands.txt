Basic GIT commands
	Start working on a new branch
-	Create a new user story and create a new branch on tfs / the origin repo
-	Check current branch in your local repo: git branch
-	Switch to Dev branch (skip this step if the current branch is dev): git checkout develop
-	Download contents from the remote repo: git fetch
-	Merge the new data into your current working copy files: git pull
-	Switch to the new branch: git checkout <branch no>

	Ready to create pull request and do code review
-	Add all the changes in the working directory to the staging area: git add .
-	Commit the staged changes: git commit
-	Publish and upload local changes to the remote repo: git push

	Resolve code conflicts
-	Make sure all the local changes are already pushed to remote repo (see the 2nd point above);
-	Switch to dev branch: git checkout develop
-	Pull the latest contents from dev branch: git pull
-	Switch back to your own branch: git checkout <branch no>
-	Merge the latest contents of dev with the contents of your local branch: git merge develop
-	Files with conflicted contents will be listed after previous command, manually resolve the conflicts in files are needed (this step should be done with Architect team)
